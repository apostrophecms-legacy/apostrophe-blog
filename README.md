# apostrophe-blog

`apostrophe-blog` adds blogging to the [Apostrophe](http://github.com/punkave/apostrophe) content management system. `apostrophe-blog` provides both backend and frontend components, including a friendly UI built on Apostrophe's rich content editing features.

An RSS feed is included, with autodiscovery for browsers that support it (not many these days alas).

### Code Stability
